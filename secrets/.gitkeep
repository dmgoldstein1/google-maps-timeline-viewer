# This directory contains sensitive API keys and secrets
# Never commit actual secret files to version control
#
# To set up your API key:
# 1. Create a file named 'google_api_key.txt' in this directory
# 2. Paste your Google Maps API key into the file (no newlines or extra spaces)
# 3. Ensure the file is listed in .gitignore (it should be by default)
#
# Example:
#   echo "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" > secrets/google_api_key.txt
